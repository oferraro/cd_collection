<p>The CD collection system allows you to Create, Remove, Update and Delete Albums, Bands and Artists.</p>
<p>In order to create an Album its required create Artists and Bands first, if not, the system will not allow you to create bands.</p>
<p>In the list of the Albums, by clicking the picture its possible to view in a modal the picture in the original size</p>
<p><h3>In order to improve the system:</h3>
	- Create a search form <br>
	- Add the option of multiple artists (when creating an album) <br>
	- Autocomplete in the search <br>
	- Use Ajax to check if the Artist and Band exists before submit <br>
	- Allow to create Artists and Bands without leave the "add album" form <br>
	- Auto remove the images in the upload folder (when the row is deleted in the database <br>
	- Create folders as part of the path of the image using the date (in order to have more performance when there are many photos <br>
	- Create pagination in the lists <br>
	- Dont allow the users to upload big pictures <br>
	- Limit the picture size in the modal (big view) <br>
	- Etc, there are many things to do this much better.
